**Cosma** is a document graph visualization tool. It modelizes interlinked Markdown files and renders them as an interactive network in a web interface.

Visit <https://cosma.graphlab.fr/en/about/> to learn more about the project.

This is the command-line interface (CLI) version of Cosma. It requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/fr/) v16 or higher.

## Documentation

User and developer documentation for Cosma CLI will be published progressively in 2022 at <https://cosma.graphlab.fr/docs>.

## History

The first version of Cosma was a CLI prototype developed during late 2020 and early 2021. We then worked on a GUI version with Electron, and in the process much of the code was changed. After publishing the GUI version as Cosma 1.0, we came back to the CLI prototype and worked on integrating all the changes. As a result, Cosma is available again as a CLI tool.
