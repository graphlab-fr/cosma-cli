## History

The first version of Cosma was a CLI prototype developed during late 2020 and early 2021. We then worked on a GUI version with Electron, and in the process much of the code was changed. After publishing the GUI version as Cosma 1.0, we came back to the CLI prototype and worked on integrating all the changes. As a result, Cosma is available again as a CLI tool. Version 2.0 has been released in April 2023.
